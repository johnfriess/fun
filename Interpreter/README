Due:
    test: 1/31/2023 @ 11:59pm
    code: 2/01/2023 @ 11:59pm

Objectives:
~~~~~~~~~~~

    - become better at C
    - become better at writing simple interpreters
    - work with your peers on a common design problem

Assignment:
~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Work as a group to define an extension of the language from p1 to include
      if statements, while loops, and functions.
    - Donate a test case
    - Implement an interpreter (in C) for the new language

The language (it's a stretch to call it that):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - You define it as a group

Important files:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    *.c     C files, feel free to add them, remove them, edit them, etc.
    *.h     header files, feel free to add them, remove them, edit them, etc.

How to add your test:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    To add your test, create 2 files:

       <your CSID>.fun     contains the fun program
       <your CSID>.ok      contains the expected output

    Don't forget to commit them to git (for example):

       git add <your CSID>.fun <your CSID>.ok # add the files
       git commit -a -m "added test"          # commit your change locally
       git push                               # push to server
    
Generated files:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    for each test:

        <test>.out    output from running the test
        <test>.diff   differences between the actual and expected output
        <test>.result pass/fail

To get notifications (will be sent to <your csid>@cs.utexas.edu):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add an empty file named "spamon" in your project directory. Don't forget
to "git add", "git commit", "git push"

To run tests:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make test

To make the output less noisy:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make -s test

To run one test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make -s t0.test

To run by hand
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    ./p1 < t0.fun
